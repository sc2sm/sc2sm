# TasteMatch – Sample BuildInPublic Posts for X

## 🧪 Post 1 – Food Tagging UI

Just shipped our food preference tagging UI 🍣🌮🥗  
You can now express your taste with emojis — feels fun and fast.  
Matching on flavor just got real.  

Curious how others balance fun vs data fidelity in onboarding?

## 🧪 Post 2 – Taste Match Score

Built the first version of our match score engine — compares mutual food loves + flags hard dealbreakers (pineapple on pizza types beware 🍍🍕).  
Early tests are… spicy 🌶️  
Still tuning weights, but this feels like magic.

## 🧪 Post 3 – Swipe Bug Fix

Fixed a weird swipe bug where video profiles broke “right” swipes.  
Turns out autoplay was hijacking touch events on Android.  
Love how even the smallest UX hiccup forces us to revisit assumptions.  
Back to smooth swiping 🔄
